#### s3 (Amazon S3)

- STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- STORAGE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
- STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT
- STORAGE_S3_REGION

## Repository configuration

```json
//.turbo/config.json
{
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:8080/turbo/api",
  "loginUrl": "http://localhost:8080/turbo/login"
}
```

// Link the repository to this remote server caching

```
npx turbo login
npx turbo link
```

## Development

- Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

- Launch a postgres database
  You can use Docker with the docker-commpose.db.yml file if you want

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up -d
```

- Launche the remix dev server

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it.

You can also use the Dockerfile

## HTTP2 support (e.g. for Google CloudRun)

In some cases you may need to use HTTP/2. To do so set the environment variable USE_HTTP2_NO_TLS=1.

E.g. **Google CloudRun** will have a payload limit of 32MB if you use HTTP/1.1, but some artifacts may be bigger than that.
There is no limit when using HTTP/2.

Make sure to set `--use-http2` on cloud run. See https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/http2
